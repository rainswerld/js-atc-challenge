# Air Traffic Control Challenge

## Prerequisites

-   [JavaScript Objects Stack Challenge](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/js-objects-stack-challenge)

## Instructions

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
1.  Change into the new directory.
1.  Install dependencies.
1.  Create and checkout a new branch to work on.
1.  Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available in [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js). A pull
request is not required, but it is necessary if you want a code review.

You may wish to refer to [FAQs](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki)
related to [forking,
cloning](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone).

## Requirements

We have been contracted to write a software subsystem for an air traffic control
system. This software manages a queue of aircrafts and prioritizes the orders of
take offs and landings based on the aircraft's type and size. Write a
constructor function, `ATCQueue`, that creates and manages the aircraft queue.

Aircrafts are represented by objects that have at least, but are not limited to,
the following properties.

| Property | Value |
| - | - |
| `type` | `passenger` or `cargo` |
| `size` | `small` or `large` |

The aircraft queue should implement the following interface.

| Method | Parameters | Return | Notes |
| - | - | - | - |
| `aircraftCount()` | None | Integer | Count the number of aircrafts in the queue. |
| `enqueue()` | Aircraft | None | Add an aircraft to the queue. |
| `dequeue()` | None | Aircraft | Remove an aircraft from the queue and return it. |

The process that manages the aircraft queue satisfies the following conditions.
-   There is no limit on the size of the aircraft queue.
-   Aircrafts are dequeued according to their priority.
    -   Passenger aircrafts have higher priority than cargo aircrafts.
    -   If two aircrafts have the same type but different sizes, then the large
        aircraft has a higher priority.
    -   If there is more than one aircraft with the same type and size, then the
        aircraft that was enqueued earlier has higher priority.

You should be running `grunt nag` before diagnosing any bugs, since it finds
some of the most common sources of errors. After `grunt nag` passes, you should
run `grunt test` to run the included tests. Tests will tell you whether of not
you've met these requirements.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `grunt nag`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains.
-   `grunt test`: runs any automated tests; may depend on `grunt build`.
-   `grunt`: runs both `nag` and then `test`
-   `grunt make-standard`: reformats all your code in the standard style.
